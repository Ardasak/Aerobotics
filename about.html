<h2 class="section-heading">Our Mission</h2>

<p>
    Hi there, here are the mentors of Aerobotics! "Passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent," says Larry Smith, a professor of economics at the University of Waterloo. Our mission is to help students from grades 7 to 10 ignite their curiosity and passion, and learn not only technical skills such as assembly, electronics and programming; but also valuable soft skills that will be increasingly important in the changing society. We aim to do these, thanks to an organization called FIRST, by exploring the magical world of robotics.

<h2 class="section-heading">Our Vision</h2>

<p>
    We want to inspire and empower the next generation of STEM professionals by working on the limitless possibilities within robotics. We wish to build a community where creativity, persistence, and teamwork help us achieve uncommon results. As we advance through our journey, we aspire to learn new things, have fun and impact everyone's daily lives. Who knows, maybe one of our members will find a way to cure Alzheimer's in the future B). Look at what Arda has to say about <a href="">his experience in FIRST</a>!
